-- 	<Esc>, CTRL-O or <CR>, the indent is deleted again.  Moving the cursor
-- 	to another line has the same effect, unless the 'I' flag is included
-- 	in 'cpoptions'.
-- 	When autoindent is on, formatting (with the "gq" command or when you

-- 	line.
-- 	When 'smartindent' or 'cindent' is on the indent is changed in

-- 	The 'autoindent' option is reset when the 'paste' option is set and

-- 	Also, 'fileformat' and 'fileformats' options will not be used, the

-- 	The 'fileencoding' and 'fileencodings' options will not be used, the
-- 	file is read without conversion.
-- 	NOTE: When you start editing a(nother) file while the 'bin' option is
-- 	on, settings from autocommands may change the settings again (e.g.,
-- 	'textwidth'), causing trouble when editing.  You might want to set
-- 	'bin' again when the file has been loaded.
-- 	The previous values of these options are remembered and restored when

-- 	saved option values.
-- 	To edit a file with 'binary' set you can use the |++bin| argument.
-- 	This avoids you have to do ":set bin", which would have effect for all
-- 	files you edit.
-- 	When writing a file the <EOL> for the last line is only written if
-- 	there was one in the original file (normally Vim appends an <EOL> to
-- 	the last line if there is none; this would make the file longer).  See

-- 	Some applications use the BOM to recognize the encoding of the file.
-- 	Often used for UCS-2 files on MS-Windows.  For other applications it

-- 	appear halfway through the resulting file.  Gcc doesn't accept a BOM.
-- 	When Vim reads a file and 'fileencodings' starts with "ucs-bom", a
-- 	check for the presence of the BOM is done and 'bomb' set accordingly.
-- 	Unless 'binary' is set, it is removed from the first line, so that you

-- 	  impossible!).  Writing may fail because of this.
-- 	- A directory "." means to put the backup file in the same directory
-- 	  as the edited file.
-- 	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for Windows) means to
-- 	  put the backup file relative to where the edited file is.  The

-- 	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.

-- 	- For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//",

-- 	  On Win32, it is also possible to end with "\\".  However, When a

-- 	- Empty means that no swap file will be used (recovery is
-- 	  impossible!) and no |E303| error will be given.
-- 	- A directory "." means to put the swap file in the same directory as
-- 	  the edited file.  On Unix, a dot is prepended to the file name, so
-- 	  it doesn't show in a directory listing.  On MS-Windows the "hidden"
-- 	  attribute is set and a dot prepended if possible.
-- 	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for Windows) means to
-- 	  put the swap file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading
-- 	  "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
-- 	- For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//",
-- 	  the swap file name will be built from the complete path to the file
-- 	  with all path separators substituted to percent '%' signs. This will
-- 	  ensure file name uniqueness in the preserve directory.
-- 	  On Win32, it is also possible to end with "\\".  However, When a
-- 	  separating comma is following, you must use "//", since "\\" will
-- 	  include the comma in the file name. Therefore it is recommended to
-- 	  use '//', instead of '\\'.
-- 	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
-- 	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
-- 	  name, precede it with a backslash.
-- 	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
-- 	- A directory name may end in an ':' or '/'.
-- 	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
-- 	- Careful with '\' characters, type one before a space, type two to

-- <	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a '>' at the start
-- 	  of the option is removed.
-- 	Using "." first in the list is recommended.  This means that editing
-- 	the same file twice will result in a warning.  Using "/tmp" on Unix is
-- 	discouraged: When the system crashes you lose the swap file.
-- 	"/var/tmp" is often not cleared when rebooting, thus is a better
-- 	choice than "/tmp".  But it can contain a lot of files, your swap
-- 	files get lost in the crowd.  That is why a "tmp" directory in your
-- 	home directory is tried first.
-- 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
-- 	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version

-- 		WARNING: Conversion can cause loss of information! You can use

-- 		that can't be converted.
-- 	For an empty file or a file with only ASCII characters most encodings
-- 	will work and the first entry of 'fileencodings' will be used (except
-- 	"ucs-bom", which requires the BOM to be present).  If you prefer
-- 	another encoding use an BufReadPost autocommand event to test if your
-- 	preferred encoding is to be used.  Example: >
-- 		au BufReadPost * if search('\S', 'w') == 0 |
-- 			\ set fenc=iso-2022-jp | endif
-- <	This sets 'fileencoding' to "iso-2022-jp" if the file does not contain

-- 	When the |++enc| argument is used then the value of 'fileencodings' is

-- 	Note that 'fileencodings' is not used for a new file, the global value
-- 	of 'fileencoding' is used instead.  You can set it with: >
-- 		:setglobal fenc=iso-8859-2
-- <	This means that a non-existing file may get a different encoding than
-- 	an empty file.
-- 	The special value "ucs-bom" can be used to check for a Unicode BOM
-- 	(Byte Order Mark) at the start of the file.  It must not be preceded
-- 	by "utf-8" or another Unicode encoding for this to work properly.
-- 	An entry for an 8-bit encoding (e.g., "latin1") should be the last,
-- 	because Vim cannot detect an error, thus the encoding is always
-- 	accepted.
-- 	The special value "default" can be used for the encoding from the
-- 	environment.  It is useful when your environment uses a non-latin1
-- 	encoding, such as Russian.
-- 	When a file contains an illegal UTF-8 byte sequence it won't be

-- 	CTRL-D).  Useful if your terminal scrolls very slowly.
-- 	When set to a negative number from -1 to -100 this is used as the

-- 	in the middle of the window (except at the start or end of the file or
-- 	when long lines wrap).

-- 	This is a comma-separated list of words that specifies how
-- 	'scrollbind' windows should behave.  'sbo' stands for ScrollBind
-- 	Options.
-- 	The following words are available:
-- 	    ver		Bind vertical scrolling for 'scrollbind' windows
-- 	    hor		Bind horizontal scrolling for 'scrollbind' windows
-- 	    jump	Applies to the offset between two windows for vertical
-- 			scrolling.  This offset is the difference in the first
-- 			displayed line of the bound windows.  When moving
-- 			around in a window, another 'scrollbind' window may
-- 			reach a position before the start or after the end of
-- 			the buffer.  The offset is not changed though, when
-- 			moving back the 'scrollbind' window will try to scroll
-- 			to the desired position when possible.
-- 			When now making that window the current one, two
-- 			things can be done with the relative offset:
-- 			1. When "jump" is not included, the relative offset is
-- 			   adjusted for the scroll position in the new current
-- 			   window.  When going back to the other window, the
-- 			   new relative offset will be used.
-- 			2. When "jump" is included, the other windows are
-- 			   scrolled to keep the same relative offset.  When
-- 			   going back to the other window, it still uses the
-- 			   same relative offset.
-- 	Also see |scroll-binding|.
-- 	When 'diff' mode is active there always is vertical scroll binding,
-- 	even when "ver" isn't there.

-- 	which specifies the value of that parameter.  If a particular
-- 	character is left out, then the default value is used for that
-- 	parameter.  The following is a list of the identifying characters and
-- 	the effect of their value.
-- 	CHAR	VALUE	~
-- 							*shada-!*
-- 	!	When included, save and restore global variables that start
-- 		with an uppercase letter, and don't contain a lowercase
-- 		letter.  Thus "KEEPTHIS and "K_L_M" are stored, but "KeepThis"
-- 		and "_K_L_M" are not.  Nested List and Dict items may not be
-- 		read back correctly, you end up with an empty item.
-- 							*shada-quote*
-- 	"	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  Old name of
-- 		the '<' item, with the disadvantage that you need to put a
-- 		backslash before the ", otherwise it will be recognized as the
-- 		start of a comment!
-- 							*shada-%*
-- 	%	When included, save and restore the buffer list.  If Vim is
-- 		started with a file name argument, the buffer list is not
-- 		restored.  If Vim is started without a file name argument, the
-- 		buffer list is restored from the shada file.  Quickfix
-- 		('buftype'), unlisted ('buflisted'), unnamed and buffers on
-- 		removable media (|shada-r|) are not saved.
-- 		When followed by a number, the number specifies the maximum
-- 		number of buffers that are stored.  Without a number all
-- 		buffers are stored.
-- 							*shada-'*
-- 	'	Maximum number of previously edited files for which the marks
-- 		are remembered.  This parameter must always be included when
-- 		'shada' is non-empty.
-- 		Including this item also means that the |jumplist| and the
-- 		|changelist| are stored in the shada file.
-- 							*shada-/*
-- 	/	Maximum number of items in the search pattern history to be
-- 		saved.  If non-zero, then the previous search and substitute
-- 		patterns are also saved.  When not included, the value of
-- 		'history' is used.
-- 							*shada-:*
-- 	:	Maximum number of items in the command-line history to be
-- 		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
-- 							*shada-<*
-- 	<	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  If zero then
-- 		registers are not saved.  When not included, all lines are
-- 		saved.  '"' is the old name for this item.
-- 		Also see the 's' item below: limit specified in KiB.
-- 							*shada-@*
-- 	@	Maximum number of items in the input-line history to be
-- 		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
-- 							*shada-c*
-- 	c	Dummy option, kept for compatibility reasons.  Has no actual
-- 		effect: ShaDa always uses UTF-8 and 'encoding' value is fixed
-- 		to UTF-8 as well.
-- 							*shada-f*
-- 	f	Whether file marks need to be stored.  If zero, file marks ('0
-- 		to '9, 'A to 'Z) are not stored.  When not present or when
-- 		non-zero, they are all stored.  '0 is used for the current
-- 		cursor position (when exiting or when doing |:wshada|).
-- 							*shada-h*
-- 	h	Disable the effect of 'hlsearch' when loading the shada
-- 		file.  When not included, it depends on whether ":nohlsearch"
-- 		has been used since the last search command.
-- 							*shada-n*
-- 	n	Name of the shada file.  The name must immediately follow
-- 		the 'n'.  Must be at the end of the option!  If the
-- 		'shadafile' option is set, that file name overrides the one
-- 		given here with 'shada'.  Environment variables are
-- 		expanded when opening the file, not when setting the option.
-- 							*shada-r*
-- 	r	Removable media.  The argument is a string (up to the next
-- 		',').  This parameter can be given several times.  Each
-- 		specifies the start of a path for which no marks will be
-- 		stored.  This is to avoid removable media.  For Windows you
-- 		could use "ra:,rb:".  You can also use it for temp files,
-- 		e.g., for Unix: "r/tmp".  Case is ignored.
-- 							*shada-s*
-- 	s	Maximum size of an item contents in KiB.  If zero then nothing
-- 		is saved.  Unlike Vim this applies to all items, except for
-- 		the buffer list and header.  Full item size is off by three
-- 		unsigned integers: with `s10` maximum item size may be 1 byte
-- 		(type: 7-bit integer) + 9 bytes (timestamp: up to 64-bit
-- 		integer) + 3 bytes (item size: up to 16-bit integer because
-- 		2^8 < 10240 < 2^16) + 10240 bytes (requested maximum item
-- 		contents size) = 10253 bytes.
vim.o.shada = "!,'100,<50,s10,h"
-- string	(default: "")
-- 			global
-- 	When non-empty, overrides the file name used for |shada| (viminfo).
-- 	When equal to "NONE" no shada file will be read or written.
-- 	This option can be set with the |-i| command line flag.  The |--clean|
-- 	command line flag sets it to "NONE".
-- 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
-- 	security reasons.
vim.o.shadafile = ""
-- string	(default $SHELL or "sh",
-- 					Windows: "cmd.exe")
-- 			global
-- 	Name of the shell to use for ! and :! commands.  When changing the
-- 	value also check these options: 'shellpipe', 'shellslash'
-- 	'shellredir', 'shellquote', 'shellxquote' and 'shellcmdflag'.
-- 	It is allowed to give an argument to the command, e.g.  "csh -f".
-- 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
-- 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
-- 	If the name of the shell contains a space, you might need to enclose
-- 	it in quotes.  Example: >
-- 		:set shell=\"c:\program\ files\unix\sh.exe\"\ -f
-- <	Note the backslash before each quote (to avoid starting a comment) and
-- 	each space (to avoid ending the option value), so better use |:let-&|
-- 	like this: >
-- 		:let &shell='"C:\Program Files\unix\sh.exe" -f'
-- <	Also note that the "-f" is not inside the quotes, because it is not
-- 	part of the command name.
-- 							*shell-unquoting*
-- 	Rules regarding quotes:
-- 	1. Option is split on space and tab characters that are not inside
-- 	   quotes: "abc def" runs shell named "abc" with additional argument
-- 	   "def", '"abc def"' runs shell named "abc def" with no additional
-- 	   arguments (here and below: additional means “additional to
-- 	   'shellcmdflag'”).
-- 	2. Quotes in option may be present in any position and any number:
-- 	   '"abc"', '"a"bc', 'a"b"c', 'ab"c"' and '"a"b"c"' are all equivalent
-- 	   to just "abc".
-- 	3. Inside quotes backslash preceding backslash means one backslash.
-- 	   Backslash preceding quote means one quote. Backslash preceding
-- 	   anything else means backslash and next character literally:
-- 	   '"a\\b"' is the same as "a\b", '"a\\"b"' runs shell named literally
-- 	   'a"b', '"a\b"' is the same as "a\b" again.
-- 	4. Outside of quotes backslash always means itself, it cannot be used
-- 	   to escape quote: 'a\"b"' is the same as "a\b".
-- 	Note that such processing is done after |:set| did its own round of
-- 	unescaping, so to keep yourself sane use |:let-&| like shown above.
-- 							*shell-powershell*
-- 	To use powershell: >
-- 		let &shell = has('win32') ? 'powershell' : 'pwsh'
-- 		set shellquote= shellpipe=\| shellxquote=
-- 		set shellcmdflag=-NoLogo\ -NoProfile\ -ExecutionPolicy\ RemoteSigned\ -Command

-- 	Before using the 'shell' option a path is removed, thus "/bin/sh" uses
-- 	"sh".
-- 	The initialization of this option is done after reading the vimrc
-- 	and the other initializations, so that when the 'shell' option is set
-- 	there, the 'shellpipe' option changes automatically, unless it was

-- 	When 'shellpipe' is set to an empty string, no redirection of the
-- 	":make" output will be done.  This is useful if you use a 'makeprg'
-- 	that writes to 'makeef' by itself.  If you want no piping, but do
-- 	want to include the 'makeef', set 'shellpipe' to a single space.
-- 	Don't forget to precede the space with a backslash: ":set sp=\ ".
-- 	In the future pipes may be used for filtering and this option will

-- 	The initialization of this option is done after reading the vimrc
-- 	and the other initializations, so that when the 'shell' option is set

-- 							*viminfo-<*
-- 	<	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  If zero then
-- 		registers are not saved.  When not included, all lines are
-- 		saved.  '"' is the old name for this item.
-- 		Also see the 's' item below: limit specified in Kbyte.
-- 							*viminfo-@*
-- 	@	Maximum number of items in the input-line history to be
-- 		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
-- 							*viminfo-c*
-- 	c	When included, convert the text in the viminfo file from the
-- 		'encoding' used when writing the file to the current
-- 		'encoding'.  See |viminfo-encoding|.
-- 							*viminfo-f*
-- 	f	Whether file marks need to be stored.  If zero, file marks ('0
-- 		to '9, 'A to 'Z) are not stored.  When not present or when
-- 		non-zero, they are all stored.  '0 is used for the current
-- 		cursor position (when exiting or when doing ":wviminfo").
-- 							*viminfo-h*
-- 	h	Disable the effect of 'hlsearch' when loading the viminfo
-- 		file.  When not included, it depends on whether ":nohlsearch"
-- 		has been used since the last search command.
-- 							*viminfo-n*
-- 	n	Name of the viminfo file.  The name must immediately follow
-- 		the 'n'.  Must be at the end of the option!  If the
-- 		'viminfofile' option is set, that file name overrides the one
-- 		given here with 'viminfo'.  Environment variables are
-- 		expanded when opening the file, not when setting the option.
-- 							*viminfo-r*
-- 	r	Removable media.  The argument is a string (up to the next
-- 		',').  This parameter can be given several times.  Each
-- 		specifies the start of a path for which no marks will be
-- 		stored.  This is to avoid removable media.  For MS-DOS you
-- 		could use "ra:,rb:", for Amiga "rdf0:,rdf1:,rdf2:".  You can
-- 		also use it for temp files, e.g., for Unix: "r/tmp".  Case is
-- 		ignored.  Maximum length of each 'r' argument is 50
-- 		characters.
-- 							*viminfo-s*
-- 	s	Maximum size of an item in Kbyte.  If zero then registers are
-- 		not saved.  Currently only applies to registers.  The default
-- 		"s10" will exclude registers with more than 10 Kbyte of text.
-- 		Also see the '<' item above: line count limit.

-- 	When 'l' is included and it is used after an operator at the end of a
