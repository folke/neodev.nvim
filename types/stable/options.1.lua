-- 	When this option is not empty, it determines the content of the ruler
-- 	string, as displayed for the 'ruler' option.
-- 	The format of this option is like that of 'statusline'.
-- 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when 'modelineexpr' is off.
-- 	The default ruler width is 17 characters.  To make the ruler 15
-- 	characters wide, put "%15(" at the start and "%)" at the end.

-- 	And any other file searched for with the |:runtime| command.
-- 	Defaults are setup to search these locations:
-- 	1. Your home directory, for personal preferences.
-- 	   Given by `stdpath("config")`.  |$XDG_CONFIG_HOME|
-- 	2. Directories which must contain configuration files according to
-- 	   |xdg| ($XDG_CONFIG_DIRS, defaults to /etc/xdg).  This also contains
-- 	   preferences from system administrator.
-- 	3. Data home directory, for plugins installed by user.
-- 	   Given by `stdpath("data")/site`.  |$XDG_DATA_HOME|
-- 	4. nvim/site subdirectories for each directory in $XDG_DATA_DIRS.
-- 	   This is for plugins which were installed by system administrator,
-- 	   but are not part of the Nvim distribution. XDG_DATA_DIRS defaults
-- 	   to /usr/local/share/:/usr/share/, so system administrators are
-- 	   expected to install site plugins to /usr/share/nvim/site.
-- 	5. Applications state home directory, for files that contain your
-- 	   session state (eg. backupdir, viewdir, undodir, etc).
-- 	   Given by `stdpath("state")`.  |$XDG_STATE_HOME|
-- 	6. $VIMRUNTIME, for files distributed with Neovim.
-- 	7, 8, 9, 10. In after/ subdirectories of 1, 2, 3 and 4, with reverse
-- 	   ordering.  This is for preferences to overrule or add to the
-- 	   distributed defaults or system-wide settings (rarely needed).
-- 	"start" packages will additionally be used to search for runtime files
-- 	after these, but package entries are not visible in `:set rtp`.
-- 	See |runtime-search-path| for more information. "opt" packages
-- 	will be explicitly added to &rtp when |:packadd| is used.
-- 	Note that, unlike 'path', no wildcards like "" are allowed.  Normal
-- 	wildcards are allowed, but can significantly slow down searching for
-- 	runtime files.  For speed, use as few items as possible and avoid
-- 	wildcards.
-- 	See |:runtime|.
-- 	Example: >
-- 		:set runtimepath=~/vimruntime,/mygroup/vim,$VIMRUNTIME
-- 	personal Vim runtime files), then "/mygroup/vim" (shared between a
-- 	group of people) and finally "$VIMRUNTIME" (the distributed runtime
-- 	files).
-- 	You probably should always include $VIMRUNTIME somewhere, to use the
-- 	distributed runtime files.  You can put a directory before $VIMRUNTIME
-- 	to find files which replace a distributed runtime files.  You can put
-- 	a directory after $VIMRUNTIME to find files which add to distributed
-- 	runtime files.
-- 	When Vim is started with |--clean| the home directory entries are not
-- 	included.
-- 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for

-- number	(default 1)
-- 			global
-- 	Minimal number of lines to scroll when the cursor gets off the
-- 	screen (e.g., with "j").  Not used for scroll commands (e.g., CTRL-E,
-- 	CTRL-D).  Useful if your terminal scrolls very slowly.
-- 	When set to a negative number from -1 to -100 this is used as the
-- 	percentage of the window height.  Thus -50 scrolls half the window
-- 	height.
vim.o.scrolljump = "1"
-- number	(default 0)
-- 			global or local to window |global-local|
-- 	Minimal number of screen lines to keep above and below the cursor.
-- 	This will make some context visible around where you are working.  If
-- 	you set it to a very large value (999) the cursor line will always be
-- 	in the middle of the window (except at the start or end of the file or
-- 	when long lines wrap).
-- 	After using the local value, go back the global value with one of
-- 	these two: >
-- 		setlocal scrolloff<
-- 		setlocal scrolloff=-1
vim.o.scrolloff = "0"
-- string	(default "ver,jump")
-- 			global
-- 	This is a comma-separated list of words that specifies how
-- 	'scrollbind' windows should behave.  'sbo' stands for ScrollBind
-- 	Options.
-- 	The following words are available:
-- 	    ver		Bind vertical scrolling for 'scrollbind' windows
-- 	    hor		Bind horizontal scrolling for 'scrollbind' windows
-- 	    jump	Applies to the offset between two windows for vertical
-- 			scrolling.  This offset is the difference in the first
-- 			displayed line of the bound windows.  When moving
-- 			around in a window, another 'scrollbind' window may
-- 			reach a position before the start or after the end of
-- 			the buffer.  The offset is not changed though, when
-- 			moving back the 'scrollbind' window will try to scroll
-- 			to the desired position when possible.
-- 			When now making that window the current one, two
-- 			things can be done with the relative offset:
-- 			1. When "jump" is not included, the relative offset is
-- 			   adjusted for the scroll position in the new current
-- 			   window.  When going back to the other window, the
-- 			   new relative offset will be used.
-- 			2. When "jump" is included, the other windows are
-- 			   scrolled to keep the same relative offset.  When
-- 			   going back to the other window, it still uses the
-- 			   same relative offset.
-- 	Also see |scroll-binding|.
-- 	When 'diff' mode is active there always is vertical scroll binding,
-- 	even when "ver" isn't there.
vim.o.scrollopt = "ver,jump"
-- string	(default "SHNHH HUnhsh")
-- 			global
-- 	Specifies the nroff macros that separate sections.  These are pairs of
-- 	two letters (See |object-motions|).  The default makes a section start
-- 	at the nroff macros ".SH", ".NH", ".H", ".HU", ".nh" and ".sh".
vim.o.sections = "SHNHH HUnhsh"
-- boolean	(default off)
-- 			global
-- 	When on, ":autocmd", shell and write commands are not allowed in
-- 	".nvimrc" and ".exrc" in the current directory and map commands are
-- 	displayed.  Switch it off only if you know that you will not run into
-- 	problems, or when the 'exrc' option is off.  On Unix this option is
-- 	only used if the ".nvimrc" or ".exrc" is not owned by you.  This can be
-- 	dangerous if the systems allows users to do a "chown".  You better set
-- 	'secure' at the end of your |init.vim| then.
-- 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
-- 	security reasons.
vim.o.secure = "false"
-- string	(default "inclusive")
-- 			global
-- 	This option defines the behavior of the selection.  It is only used

-- 	Possible values:
-- 	   value	past line     inclusive ~
-- 	   old		   no		yes
-- 	   inclusive	   yes		yes
-- 	   exclusive	   yes		no
-- 	"past line" means that the cursor is allowed to be positioned one
-- 	character past the line.
-- 	"inclusive" means that the last character of the selection is included
-- 	in an operation.  For example, when "x" is used to delete the
-- 	selection.
-- 	When "old" is used and 'virtualedit' allows the cursor to move past
-- 	the end of line the line break still isn't included.
-- 	Note that when "exclusive" is used and selecting from the end
-- 	backwards, you cannot include the last character of a line, when
-- 	starting in Normal mode and 'virtualedit' empty.
-- 	The 'selection' option is set by the |:behave| command.
vim.o.selection = "inclusive"
-- string	(default "")

-- 	   key		when using shifted special keys
-- 	   cmd		when using "v", "V" or CTRL-V
-- 	See |Select-mode|.

-- 			global
-- 	Changes the effect of the |:mksession| command.  It is a comma-

-- 	something:
-- 	   word		save and restore ~
-- 	   blank	empty windows
-- 	   buffers	hidden and unloaded buffers, not just those in windows
-- 	   curdir	the current directory
-- 	   folds	manually created folds, opened/closed folds and local
-- 			fold options
-- 	   globals	global variables that start with an uppercase letter
-- 			and contain at least one lowercase letter.  Only
-- 			String and Number types are stored.
-- 	   help		the help window
-- 	   localoptions	options and mappings local to a window or buffer (not
-- 			global values for local options)
-- 	   options	all options and mappings (also global values for local
-- 			options)
-- 	   skiprtp	exclude 'runtimepath' and 'packpath' from the options
-- 	   resize	size of the Vim window: 'lines' and 'columns'
-- 	   sesdir	the directory in which the session file is located
-- 			will become the current directory (useful with
-- 			projects accessed over a network from different
-- 			systems)
-- 	   tabpages	all tab pages; without this only the current tab page
-- 			is restored, so that you can make a session for each
-- 			tab page separately
-- 	   terminal	include terminal windows where the command can be
-- 			restored
-- 	   winpos	position of the whole Vim window
-- 	   winsize	window sizes
-- 	   slash	|deprecated| Always enabled. Uses "/" in filenames.
-- 	   unix		|deprecated| Always enabled. Uses "\n" line endings.
-- 	Don't include both "curdir" and "sesdir". When neither is included
-- 	filenames are stored as absolute paths.
-- 	If you leave out "options" many things won't work well after restoring
-- 	the session.
vim.o.sessionoptions = "blank,buffers,curdir,folds,help,tabpages,winsize,terminal"

-- 			global
-- 	When non-empty, the shada file is read upon startup and written
-- 	when exiting Vim (see |shada-file|).  The string should be a comma-
-- 	separated list of parameters, each consisting of a single character
-- 	identifying the particular parameter, followed by a number or string
-- 	which specifies the value of that parameter.  If a particular
-- 	character is left out, then the default value is used for that
-- 	parameter.  The following is a list of the identifying characters and
-- 	the effect of their value.
-- 	CHAR	VALUE	~
-- 	!	When included, save and restore global variables that start
-- 		with an uppercase letter, and don't contain a lowercase
-- 		letter.  Thus "KEEPTHIS and "K_L_M" are stored, but "KeepThis"
-- 		and "_K_L_M" are not.  Nested List and Dict items may not be
-- 		read back correctly, you end up with an empty item.
-- 	"	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  Old name of
-- 		the '<' item, with the disadvantage that you need to put a
-- 		backslash before the ", otherwise it will be recognized as the
-- 		start of a comment!
-- 	%	When included, save and restore the buffer list.  If Vim is
-- 		started with a file name argument, the buffer list is not
-- 		restored.  If Vim is started without a file name argument, the
-- 		buffer list is restored from the shada file.  Quickfix
-- 		('buftype'), unlisted ('buflisted'), unnamed and buffers on
-- 		removable media (|shada-r|) are not saved.
-- 		When followed by a number, the number specifies the maximum
-- 		number of buffers that are stored.  Without a number all
-- 		buffers are stored.
-- 	'	Maximum number of previously edited files for which the marks
-- 		are remembered.  This parameter must always be included when
-- 		'shada' is non-empty.
-- 		Including this item also means that the |jumplist| and the
-- 		|changelist| are stored in the shada file.
-- 	/	Maximum number of items in the search pattern history to be
-- 		saved.  If non-zero, then the previous search and substitute
-- 		patterns are also saved.  When not included, the value of
-- 		'history' is used.
-- 	:	Maximum number of items in the command-line history to be
-- 		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
-- 	<	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  If zero then
-- 		registers are not saved.  When not included, all lines are
-- 		saved.  '"' is the old name for this item.
-- 		Also see the 's' item below: limit specified in KiB.
-- 	@	Maximum number of items in the input-line history to be
-- 		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
-- 	c	Dummy option, kept for compatibility reasons.  Has no actual
-- 		effect: ShaDa always uses UTF-8 and 'encoding' value is fixed
-- 		to UTF-8 as well.
-- 	f	Whether file marks need to be stored.  If zero, file marks ('0
-- 		to '9, 'A to 'Z) are not stored.  When not present or when
-- 		non-zero, they are all stored.  '0 is used for the current
-- 		cursor position (when exiting or when doing |:wshada|).
-- 	h	Disable the effect of 'hlsearch' when loading the shada
-- 		file.  When not included, it depends on whether ":nohlsearch"
-- 		has been used since the last search command.
-- 	n	Name of the shada file.  The name must immediately follow
-- 		the 'n'.  Must be at the end of the option!  If the
-- 		'shadafile' option is set, that file name overrides the one
-- 		given here with 'shada'.  Environment variables are
-- 		expanded when opening the file, not when setting the option.
-- 	r	Removable media.  The argument is a string (up to the next
-- 		',').  This parameter can be given several times.  Each
-- 		specifies the start of a path for which no marks will be
-- 		stored.  This is to avoid removable media.  For Windows you
-- 		could use "ra:,rb:".  You can also use it for temp files,
-- 		e.g., for Unix: "r/tmp".  Case is ignored.
-- 	s	Maximum size of an item contents in KiB.  If zero then nothing
-- 		is saved.  Unlike Vim this applies to all items, except for
-- 		the buffer list and header.  Full item size is off by three
-- 		unsigned integers: with `s10` maximum item size may be 1 byte
-- 		(type: 7-bit integer) + 9 bytes (timestamp: up to 64-bit
-- 		integer) + 3 bytes (item size: up to 16-bit integer because
-- 		2^8 < 10240 < 2^16) + 10240 bytes (requested maximum item
-- 		contents size) = 10253 bytes.
-- 	Example: >
-- 	    :set shada='50,<1000,s100,:0,n~/nvim/shada
-- 	'50		Marks will be remembered for the last 50 files you
-- 			edited.
-- 	<1000		Contents of registers (up to 1000 lines each) will be
-- 			remembered.
-- 	s100		Items with contents occupying more then 100 KiB are
-- 			skipped.
-- 	:0		Command-line history will not be saved.
-- 	n~/nvim/shada	The name of the file to use is "~/nvim/shada".
-- 	no /		Since '/' is not specified, the default will be used,
-- 			that is, save all of the search history, and also the
-- 			previous search and substitute patterns.
-- 	no %		The buffer list will not be saved nor read back.
-- 	no h		'hlsearch' highlighting will be restored.
-- 	When setting 'shada' from an empty value you can use |:rshada| to
-- 	load the contents of the file, this is not done automatically.
-- 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
-- 	security reasons.
vim.o.shada = "!,'100,<50,s10,h"
-- string	(default: "")
-- 			global
-- 	When non-empty, overrides the file name used for |shada| (viminfo).
-- 	When equal to "NONE" no shada file will be read or written.
-- 	This option can be set with the |-i| command line flag.  The |--clean|
-- 	command line flag sets it to "NONE".
-- 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
-- 	security reasons.
vim.o.shadafile = ""
-- string	(default $SHELL or "sh", Win32: "cmd.exe")
-- 			global
-- 	Name of the shell to use for ! and :! commands.  When changing the
-- 	value also check these options: 'shellpipe', 'shellslash'
-- 	'shellredir', 'shellquote', 'shellxquote' and 'shellcmdflag'.
-- 	It is allowed to give an argument to the command, e.g.  "csh -f".
-- 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
-- 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
-- 	If the name of the shell contains a space, you need to enclose it in
-- 	quotes.  Example with quotes: >
-- 		:set shell=\"c:\program\ files\unix\sh.exe\"\ -f
-- 	each space (to avoid ending the option value), so better use |:let-&|
-- 	like this: >
-- 		:let &shell='"C:\Program Files\unix\sh.exe" -f'
-- 	part of the command name.
-- 	Rules regarding quotes:
-- 	1. Option is split on space and tab characters that are not inside
-- 	   quotes: "abc def" runs shell named "abc" with additional argument
-- 	   "def", '"abc def"' runs shell named "abc def" with no additional
-- 	   arguments (here and below: additional means “additional to
-- 	   'shellcmdflag'”).
-- 	2. Quotes in option may be present in any position and any number:
-- 	   '"abc"', '"a"bc', 'a"b"c', 'ab"c"' and '"a"b"c"' are all equivalent
-- 	   to just "abc".
-- 	3. Inside quotes backslash preceding backslash means one backslash.
-- 	   Backslash preceding quote means one quote. Backslash preceding
-- 	   anything else means backslash and next character literally:
-- 	   '"a\\b"' is the same as "a\b", '"a\\"b"' runs shell named literally
-- 	   'a"b', '"a\b"' is the same as "a\b" again.
-- 	4. Outside of quotes backslash always means itself, it cannot be used
-- 	   to escape quote: 'a\"b"' is the same as "a\b".
-- 	Note that such processing is done after |:set| did its own round of
-- 	unescaping, so to keep yourself sane use |:let-&| like shown above.
-- 	To use PowerShell: >
-- 		let &shell = executable('pwsh') ? 'pwsh' : 'powershell'
-- 		let &shellcmdflag = '-NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Command [Console]::InputEncoding=[Console]::OutputEncoding=[System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8;'
-- 		let &shellredir = '-RedirectStandardOutput %s -NoNewWindow -Wait'
-- 		let &shellpipe = '2>&1 | Out-File -Encoding UTF8 %s; exit $LastExitCode'
-- 		set shellquote= shellxquote=
-- 	security reasons.
vim.o.shell = "/usr/bin/fish"

-- 			global
-- 	Flag passed to the shell to execute "!" and ":!" commands; e.g.,
-- 	`bash.exe -c ls` or `cmd.exe /s /c "dir"`.  For MS-Windows, the
-- 	default is set according to the value of 'shell', to reduce the need
-- 	to set this option by the user.
-- 	On Unix it can have more than one flag.  Each white space separated
-- 	part is passed as an argument to the shell command.
-- 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
-- 	See |shell-unquoting| which talks about separating this option into
-- 	multiple arguments.
-- 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for

vim.o.shellcmdflag = "-c"
-- string	(default ">", ">%s 2>&1", "| tee", "|& tee" or

-- 	String to be used to put the output of the ":make" command in the
-- 	error file.  See also |:make_makeprg|.  See |option-backslash| about
-- 	including spaces and backslashes.
-- 	The name of the temporary file can be represented by "%s" if necessary
-- 	(the file name is appended automatically if no %s appears in the value
-- 	of this option).
-- 	For MS-Windows the default is ">%s 2>&1".  The output is directly
-- 	saved in a file and not echoed to the screen.
-- 	For Unix the default is "| tee".  The stdout of the compiler is saved
-- 	in a file and echoed to the screen.  If the 'shell' option is "csh" or
-- 	"tcsh" after initializations, the default becomes "|& tee".  If the
-- 	'shell' option is "sh", "ksh", "mksh", "pdksh", "zsh", "zsh-beta",
-- 	"bash", "fish", "ash" or "dash" the default becomes "2>&1| tee".  This
-- 	means that stderr is also included.  Before using the 'shell' option a
-- 	path is removed, thus "/bin/sh" uses "sh".
-- 	The initialization of this option is done after reading the vimrc
-- 	and the other initializations, so that when the 'shell' option is set
-- 	there, the 'shellpipe' option changes automatically, unless it was
-- 	explicitly set before.
-- 	When 'shellpipe' is set to an empty string, no redirection of the
-- 	":make" output will be done.  This is useful if you use a 'makeprg'
-- 	that writes to 'makeef' by itself.  If you want no piping, but do
-- 	want to include the 'makeef', set 'shellpipe' to a single space.
-- 	Don't forget to precede the space with a backslash: ":set sp=\ ".
-- 	In the future pipes may be used for filtering and this option will
-- 	become obsolete (at least for Unix).
-- 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
-- 	security reasons.

-- 			scoring to improve the ordering.
-- 	double		Internal method that uses two methods and mixes the
-- 			results.  The first method is "fast", the other method
-- 			computes how much the suggestion sounds like the bad
-- 			word.  That only works when the language specifies
-- 			sound folding.  Can be slow and doesn't always give
-- 			better results.
-- 	fast		Internal method that only checks for simple changes:
-- 			character inserts/deletes/swaps.  Works well for
-- 			simple typing mistakes.
-- 	{number}	The maximum number of suggestions listed for |z=|.
-- 			Not used for |spellsuggest()|.  The number of
-- 			suggestions is never more than the value of 'lines'
-- 			minus two.
-- 	timeout:{millisec}   Limit the time searching for suggestions to
-- 			{millisec} milli seconds.  Applies to the following
-- 			methods.  When omitted the limit is 5000. When
-- 			negative there is no limit.
-- 	file:{filename} Read file {filename}, which must have two columns,
-- 			separated by a slash.  The first column contains the
-- 			bad word, the second column the suggested good word.
-- 			Example:
-- 				theribal/terrible ~
-- 			Use this for common mistakes that do not appear at the
-- 			top of the suggestion list with the internal methods.
-- 			Lines without a slash are ignored, use this for
-- 			comments.
-- 			The word in the second column must be correct,
-- 			otherwise it will not be used.  Add the word to an
-- 			".add" file if it is currently flagged as a spelling
-- 			mistake.
-- 			The file is used for all languages.
-- 	expr:{expr}	Evaluate expression {expr}.  Use a function to avoid
-- 			trouble with spaces.  |v:val| holds the badly spelled
-- 			word.  The expression must evaluate to a List of
-- 			Lists, each with a suggestion and a score.
-- 			Example:
-- 				[['the', 33], ['that', 44]] ~
-- 			Set 'verbose' and use |z=| to see the scores that the
-- 			internal methods use.  A lower score is better.
-- 			This may invoke |spellsuggest()| if you temporarily
-- 			set 'spellsuggest' to exclude the "expr:" part.
-- 			Errors are silently ignored, unless you set the
-- 			'verbose' option to a non-zero value.
-- 	Only one of "best", "double" or "fast" may be used.  The others may
-- 	appear several times in any order.  Example: >

-- 	  %-0{minwid}.{maxwid}{item}
-- 	All fields except the {item} are optional.  A single percent sign can
-- 	be given as "%%".
-- 	When the option starts with "%!" then it is used as an expression,

-- 		:set statusline=%!MyStatusLine()
-- 	window that the status line belongs to.
-- 	The result can contain %{} items that will be evaluated too.
-- 	Note that the "%!" expression is evaluated in the context of the

-- 	context of the window that the statusline belongs to.
-- 	When there is error while evaluating the option then it will be made
-- 	empty to avoid further errors.  Otherwise screen updating would loop.
-- 	Note that the only effect of 'ruler' when this option is set (and
-- 	'laststatus' is 2 or 3) is controlling the output of |CTRL-G|.

-- 	minwid	    Minimum width of the item, padding as set by '-' & '0'.
-- 		    Value must be 50 or less.
-- 	maxwid	    Maximum width of the item.  Truncation occurs with a '<'
-- 		    on the left for text items.  Numeric items will be

-- 	a S   Argument list status as in default title.  ({current} of {max})
-- 	      Empty if the argument file count is zero or one.
-- 	{ NF  Evaluate expression between '%{' and '}' and substitute result.
-- 	      Note that there is no '%' before the closing '}'.  The
-- 	      expression cannot contain a '}' character, call a function to
-- 	      work around that.  See |stl-%{| below.
-- 	{% -  This is almost same as { except the result of the expression is

-- 	X N   For 'tabline': start of close tab N label.  Use %X or %T to end
-- 	      the label, e.g.: %3Xclose%X.  Use %999X for a "close current

-- 	@ N   Start of execute function label. Use %X or %T to
-- 	      end the label, e.g.: %10@SwitchBuffer@foo.c%X.  Clicking this

-- 	      using left mouse button on "foo.c" "SwitchBuffer(10, 1, 'l',
-- 	      '    ')" expression will be run.  Function receives the

-- 	      1. minwid field value or zero if no N was specified
-- 	      2. number of mouse clicks to detect multiple clicks
-- 	      3. mouse button used: "l", "r" or "m" for left, right or middle
-- 	         button respectively; one should not rely on third argument
-- 	         being only "l", "r" or "m": any other non-empty string value
-- 	         that contains only ASCII lower case letters may be expected
-- 	         for other mouse buttons
-- 	      4. modifiers pressed: string which contains "s" if shift
-- 	         modifier was pressed, "c" for control, "a" for alt and "m"
-- 	         for meta; currently if modifier is not pressed string
-- 	         contains space instead, but one should not rely on presence
-- 	         of spaces or specific order of modifiers: use |stridx()| to
-- 	         test whether some modifier is present; string is guaranteed
-- 	         to contain only ASCII letters and spaces, one letter per
-- 	         modifier; "?" modifier may also be present, but its presence
-- 	         is a bug that denotes that new mouse button recognition was
-- 	         added without modifying code that reacts on mouse clicks on
-- 	         this label.
-- 	< -   Where to truncate line if too long.  Default is at the start.
-- 	      No width fields allowed.
-- 	= -   Separation point between alignment sections. Each section will
-- 	      be separated by an equal number of spaces.
-- 	      No width fields allowed.
-- 	# -   Set highlight group.  The name must follow and then a # again.
-- 	      Thus use %#HLname# for highlight group HLname.  The same
-- 	      highlighting is used, also for the statusline of non-current
-- 	      windows.
-- 	* -   Set highlight group to User{N}, where {N} is taken from the
-- 	      minwid field, e.g. %1*.  Restore normal highlight with %* or %0*.
-- 	      The difference between User{N} and StatusLine  will be applied
-- 	      to StatusLineNC for the statusline of non-current windows.

-- 	when flags are used like in the examples below.
-- 	When all items in a group becomes an empty string (i.e. flags that are
-- 	not set) and a minwid is not set for the group, the whole group will
-- 	become empty.  This will make a group like the following disappear

-- 	line is displayed.
-- 	While evaluating %{} the current buffer and current window will be set
-- 	temporarily to that of the window (and buffer) whose statusline is
-- 	currently being drawn.  The expression will evaluate in this context.
-- 	The variable "g:actual_curbuf" is set to the `bufnr()` number of the

-- 	real current window.  These values are strings.
-- 	The 'statusline' option will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from
-- 	a modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
-- 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when 'modelineexpr' is off.
-- 	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
-- 	evaluating 'statusline' |textlock|.

-- 	When searching for a tag (e.g., for the |:ta| command), Vim can either
-- 	use a binary search or a linear search in a tags file.  Binary
-- 	searching makes searching for a tag a LOT faster, but a linear search
-- 	will find more tags if the tags file wasn't properly sorted.
-- 	Vim normally assumes that your tags files are sorted, or indicate that
-- 	they are not sorted.  Only when this is not the case does the
-- 	'tagbsearch' option need to be switched off.
-- 	When 'tagbsearch' is on, binary searching is first used in the tags
-- 	files.  In certain situations, Vim will do a linear search instead for
-- 	certain files, or retry all files with a linear search.  When
-- 	'tagbsearch' is off, only a linear search is done.
-- 	Linear searching is done anyway, for one file, when Vim finds a line
-- 	at the start of the file indicating that it's not sorted: >
-- 	When a binary search was done and no match was found in any of the
-- 	files listed in 'tags', and case is ignored or a pattern is used
-- 	instead of a normal tag name, a retry is done with a linear search.
-- 	Tags in unsorted tags files, and matches with different case will only
-- 	be found in the retry.
-- 	If a tag file indicates that it is case-fold sorted, the second,
-- 	linear search can be avoided when case is ignored.  Use a value of '2'
-- 	in the "!_TAG_FILE_SORTED" line for this.  A tag file can be case-fold
-- 	sorted with the -f switch to "sort" in most unices, as in the command:
-- 	"sort -f -o tags tags".  For Universal ctags and Exuberant ctags
-- 	version 5.x or higher (at least 5.5) the --sort=foldcase switch can be
-- 	used for this as well.  Note that case must be folded to uppercase for
-- 	this to work.
-- 	By default, tag searches are case-sensitive.  Case is ignored when
-- 	'ignorecase' is set and 'tagcase' is "followic", or when 'tagcase' is
-- 	"ignore".
-- 	Also when 'tagcase' is "followscs" and 'smartcase' is set, or
-- 	'tagcase' is "smart", and the pattern contains only lowercase
-- 	characters.
-- 	When 'tagbsearch' is off, tags searching is slower when a full match
-- 	exists, but faster when no full match exists.  Tags in unsorted tags
-- 	files may only be found with 'tagbsearch' off.
-- 	When the tags file is not sorted, or sorted in a wrong way (not on
-- 	ASCII byte value), 'tagbsearch' should be off, or the line given above
-- 	must be included in the tags file.

-- 	The default "#" works well for C programs.  See |fold-indent|.
vim.wo.foldignore = "#"
-- number (default: 0)
-- 			local to window
-- 	Sets the fold level: Folds with a higher level will be closed.
-- 	Setting this option to zero will close all folds.  Higher numbers will

-- 	See |fold-foldlevel|.
vim.wo.foldlevel = "0"
-- string (default: "{{{,}}}")
-- 			local to window
-- 	The start and end marker used when 'foldmethod' is "marker".  There

-- 	See |fold-marker|.
vim.wo.foldmarker = "{{{,}}}"

-- 	|fold-indent|	indent	    Lines with equal indent form a fold.
-- 	|fold-expr|	expr	    'foldexpr' gives the fold level of a line.
-- 	|fold-marker|	marker	    Markers are used to specify folds.
-- 	|fold-syntax|	syntax	    Syntax highlighting items specify folds.
-- 	|fold-diff|	diff	    Fold text that is not changed.
vim.wo.foldmethod = "manual"
-- number (default: 1)
-- 			local to window
-- 	Sets the number of screen lines above which a fold can be displayed
-- 	closed.  Also for manually closed folds.  With the default value of
-- 	one a fold can only be closed if it takes up two or more screen lines.
-- 	Set to zero to be able to close folds of just one screen line.
-- 	Note that this only has an effect on what is displayed.  After using
-- 	"zc" to close a fold, which is displayed open because it's smaller
-- 	than 'foldminlines', a following "zc" may close a containing fold.
vim.wo.foldminlines = "1"
-- number (default: 20)
-- 			local to window
-- 	Sets the maximum nesting of folds for the "indent" and "syntax"
-- 	methods.  This avoids that too many folds will be created.  Using more

vim.wo.foldnestmax = "20"
-- string (default: "foldtext()")
-- 			local to window
-- 	An expression which is used to specify the text displayed for a closed
-- 	fold.  See |fold-foldtext|.

vim.wo.foldtext = "foldtext()"
-- boolean	(default off)
-- 			local to window
-- 	If on, Vim will wrap long lines at a character in 'breakat' rather
-- 	than at the last character that fits on the screen.  Unlike
-- 	'wrapmargin' and 'textwidth', this does not insert <EOL>s in the file,
-- 	it only affects the way the file is displayed, not its contents.
-- 	If 'breakindent' is set, line is visually indented. Then, the value
-- 	of 'showbreak' is used to put in front of wrapped lines. This option
-- 	is not used when the 'wrap' option is off.
-- 	Note that <Tab> characters after an <EOL> are mostly not displayed
-- 	with the right amount of white space.
vim.wo.linebreak = "false"
-- boolean	(default off)
-- 			local to window
-- 	List mode: By default, show tabs as ">", trailing spaces as "-", and
-- 	non-breakable space characters as "+". Useful to see the difference
-- 	between tabs and spaces and for trailing blanks. Further changed by
-- 	the 'listchars' option.
-- 	The cursor is displayed at the start of the space a Tab character
-- 	occupies, not at the end as usual in Normal mode.  To get this cursor
-- 	position while displaying Tabs with spaces, use: >
-- 		:set list lcs=tab:\ \
-- 	Note that list mode will also affect formatting (set with 'textwidth'
-- 	or 'wrapmargin') when 'cpoptions' includes 'L'.  See 'listchars' for
-- 	changing the way tabs are displayed.
vim.wo.list = "false"
-- string	(default: "tab:> ,trail:-,nbsp:+")
-- 			global or local to window |global-local|
-- 	Strings to use in 'list' mode and for the |:list| command.  It is a
-- 	comma-separated list of string settings.
-- 	  eol:c		Character to show at the end of each line.  When
-- 			omitted, there is no extra character at the end of the
-- 			line.
-- 	  tab:xy[z]	Two or three characters to be used to show a tab.
-- 			The third character is optional.
-- 	  tab:xy	The 'x' is always used, then 'y' as many times as will
-- 			fit.  Thus "tab:>-" displays:
-- 				>
-- 				>-
-- 				>--
-- 				etc.
-- 	  tab:xyz	The 'z' is always used, then 'x' is prepended, and
-- 			then 'y' is used as many times as will fit.  Thus
-- 			"tab:<->" displays:
-- 				>
-- 				<>
-- 				<->
-- 				<-->
-- 				etc.
-- 			When "tab:" is omitted, a tab is shown as ^I.
-- 	  space:c	Character to show for a space.  When omitted, spaces
-- 			are left blank.
-- 	  multispace:c...
-- 	 		One or more characters to use cyclically to show for
-- 	 		multiple consecutive spaces.  Overrides the "space"
-- 			setting, except for single spaces.  When omitted, the
-- 			"space" setting is used.  For example,
-- 			`:set listchars=multispace:---+` shows ten consecutive
-- 			spaces as:
-- 				---+---+-- ~
-- 	  lead:c	Character to show for leading spaces.  When omitted,
-- 			leading spaces are blank.  Overrides the "space" and
-- 			"multispace" settings for leading spaces.  You can
-- 			combine it with "tab:", for example: >
-- 				:set listchars+=tab:>-,lead:.
-- 	  leadmultispace:c...
-- 			Like the |lcs-multispace| value, but for leading
-- 			spaces only.  Also overrides |lcs-lead| for leading
-- 			multiple spaces.
-- 			`:set listchars=leadmultispace:---+` shows ten
-- 			consecutive leading spaces as:
-- 				---+---+--XXX ~
-- 			Where "XXX" denotes the first non-blank characters in
-- 			the line.
-- 	  trail:c	Character to show for trailing spaces.  When omitted,
-- 			trailing spaces are blank.  Overrides the "space" and
-- 			"multispace" settings for trailing spaces.
-- 	  extends:c	Character to show in the last column, when 'wrap' is
-- 			off and the line continues beyond the right of the
-- 			screen.
-- 	  precedes:c	Character to show in the first visible column of the
-- 			physical line, when there is text preceding the
-- 			character visible in the first column.
-- 	  conceal:c	Character to show in place of concealed text, when
-- 			'conceallevel' is set to 1.  A space when omitted.
-- 	  nbsp:c	Character to show for a non-breakable space character
-- 			(0xA0 (160 decimal) and U+202F).  Left blank when
-- 			omitted.
-- 	The characters ':' and ',' should not be used.  UTF-8 characters can
-- 	be used.  All characters must be single width.
-- 	Each character can be specified as hex: >
-- 		set listchars=eol:\\x24
-- 		set listchars=eol:\\u21b5
-- 		set listchars=eol:\\U000021b5
-- 	must be exactly 2 for \\x, 4 for \\u and 8 for \\U.

-- 	"lead" and "trail".
vim.wo.listchars = "tab:> ,trail:-,nbsp:+"
-- boolean	(default off)
-- 			local to window
-- 	Print the line number in front of each line.  When the 'n' option is
-- 	excluded from 'cpoptions' a wrapped line will not use the column of
-- 	line numbers.
-- 	Use the 'numberwidth' option to adjust the room for the line number.
-- 	When a long, wrapped line doesn't start with the first character, '-'
-- 	characters are put before the number.
-- 	For highlighting see |hl-LineNr|, |hl-CursorLineNr|, and the
-- 	|:sign-define| "numhl" argument.
-- 	The 'relativenumber' option changes the displayed number to be
-- 	relative to the cursor.  Together with 'number' there are these
-- 	four combinations (cursor in line 3):
-- 		'nonu'          'nu'            'nonu'          'nu'

vim.wo.number = "false"
-- number	(default: 4)
-- 			local to window
-- 	Minimal number of columns to use for the line number.  Only relevant
-- 	when the 'number' or 'relativenumber' option is set or printing lines
-- 	with a line number. Since one space is always between the number and
-- 	the text, there is one less character for the number itself.
-- 	The value is the minimum width.  A bigger width is used when needed to
-- 	fit the highest line number in the buffer respectively the number of
-- 	rows in the window, depending on whether 'number' or 'relativenumber'
-- 	is set. Thus with the Vim default of 4 there is room for a line number
-- 	up to 999. When the buffer has 1000 lines five columns will be used.
-- 	The minimum value is 1, the maximum value is 20.
vim.wo.numberwidth = "4"
-- boolean (default off)
-- 			local to window
-- 	Identifies the preview window.  Only one window can have this option
-- 	set.  It's normally not set directly, but by using one of the commands
-- 	|:ptag|, |:pedit|, etc.
vim.wo.previewwindow = "false"
-- boolean	(default off)
-- 			local to window
-- 	Show the line number relative to the line with the cursor in front of
-- 	each line. Relative line numbers help you use the |count| you can
-- 	precede some vertical motion commands (e.g. j k + -) with, without
-- 	having to calculate it yourself. Especially useful in combination with
-- 	other commands (e.g. y d c < > gq gw =).
-- 	When the 'n' option is excluded from 'cpoptions' a wrapped
-- 	line will not use the column of line numbers.
-- 	The 'numberwidth' option can be used to set the room used for the line
-- 	number.
-- 	When a long, wrapped line doesn't start with the first character, '-'
-- 	characters are put before the number.
-- 	See |hl-LineNr|  and |hl-CursorLineNr| for the highlighting used for
-- 	the number.
-- 	The number in front of the cursor line also depends on the value of
-- 	'number', see |number_relativenumber| for all combinations of the two
-- 	options.
vim.wo.relativenumber = "false"
-- boolean	(default off)
-- 			local to window
-- 	When on, display orientation becomes right-to-left, i.e., characters
-- 	that are stored in the file appear from the right to the left.
-- 	Using this option, it is possible to edit files for languages that
-- 	are written from the right to the left such as Hebrew and Arabic.
-- 	This option is per window, so it is possible to edit mixed files
-- 	simultaneously, or to view the same file in both ways (this is
-- 	useful whenever you have a mixed text file with both right-to-left
-- 	and left-to-right strings so that both sets are displayed properly
-- 	in different windows).  Also see |rileft.txt|.
vim.wo.rightleft = "false"
-- string	(default "search")
-- 			local to window
-- 	Each word in this option enables the command line editing to work in
-- 	right-to-left mode for a group of commands:
-- 		search		"/" and "?" commands
-- 	This is useful for languages such as Hebrew, Arabic and Farsi.
-- 	The 'rightleft' option must be set for 'rightleftcmd' to take effect.
vim.wo.rightleftcmd = "search"
-- number	(default: half the window height)
-- 			local to window
-- 	Number of lines to scroll with CTRL-U and CTRL-D commands.  Will be
-- 	set to half the number of lines in the window when the window size
-- 	changes.  This may happen when enabling the |status-line| or
-- 	'tabline' option after setting the 'scroll' option.
-- 	If you give a count to the CTRL-U or CTRL-D command it will
-- 	be used as the new value for 'scroll'.  Reset to half the window
-- 	height with ":set scroll=0".
vim.wo.scroll = "0"
-- boolean  (default off)
-- 			local to window
-- 	See also |scroll-binding|.  When this option is set, the current
-- 	window scrolls as other scrollbind windows (windows that also have
-- 	this option set) scroll.  This option is useful for viewing the
-- 	differences between two versions of a file, see 'diff'.
-- 	See |'scrollopt'| for options that determine how this option should be
-- 	interpreted.
-- 	This option is mostly reset when splitting a window to edit another
-- 	file.  This means that ":split | edit file" results in two windows
-- 	with scroll-binding, but ":split file" does not.
vim.wo.scrollbind = "false"
-- number	(default 0)
-- 			global or local to window |global-local|
-- 	Minimal number of screen lines to keep above and below the cursor.
-- 	This will make some context visible around where you are working.  If
-- 	you set it to a very large value (999) the cursor line will always be
-- 	in the middle of the window (except at the start or end of the file or
-- 	when long lines wrap).
-- 	After using the local value, go back the global value with one of
-- 	these two: >
-- 		setlocal scrolloff<
-- 		setlocal scrolloff=-1
vim.wo.scrolloff = "0"
-- string	(default "")
-- 			global or local to window |global-local|
-- 	String to put at the start of lines that have been wrapped.  Useful
-- 	values are "> " or "+++ ": >
-- 		:set showbreak=>\
-- 	this: >
-- 		:let &showbreak = '+++ '
-- 	comma (in a future version the comma might be used to separate the
-- 	part that is shown at the end and at the start of a line).
-- 	The |hl-NonText| highlight group determines the highlighting.
-- 	Note that tabs after the showbreak will be displayed differently.
-- 	If you want the 'showbreak' to appear in between line numbers, add the
-- 	"n" flag to 'cpoptions'.
-- 	A window-local value overrules a global value.  If the global value is
-- 	set and you want no value in the current window use NONE: >
-- 		:setlocal showbreak=NONE
vim.wo.showbreak = ""
-- number (default 0)
-- 			global or local to window |global-local|
-- 	The minimal number of screen columns to keep to the left and to the
-- 	right of the cursor if 'nowrap' is set.  Setting this option to a
-- 	value greater than 0 while having |'sidescroll'| also at a non-zero
-- 	value makes some context visible in the line you are scrolling in
-- 	horizontally (except at beginning of the line).  Setting this option
-- 	to a large value (like 999) has the effect of keeping the cursor
-- 	horizontally centered in the window, as long as one does not come too
-- 	close to the beginning of the line.
-- 	After using the local value, go back the global value with one of
-- 	these two: >
-- 		setlocal sidescrolloff<
-- 		setlocal sidescrolloff=-1
-- 	Example: Try this together with 'sidescroll' and 'listchars' as
-- 		 in the following example to never allow the cursor to move
-- 		 onto the "extends" character: >
-- 		 :set nowrap sidescroll=1 listchars=extends:>,precedes:<
-- 		 :set sidescrolloff=1
vim.wo.sidescrolloff = "0"
-- string	(default "auto")

-- 	   "auto:[1-9]" resize to accommodate multiple signs up to the
-- 	                given number (maximum 9), e.g. "auto:4"
-- 	   "auto:[1-8]-[2-9]"
-- 	                resize to accommodate multiple signs up to the
-- 			given maximum number (maximum 9) while keeping
-- 			at least the given minimum (maximum 8) fixed
-- 			space. The minimum number should always be less
-- 			than the maximum number, e.g. "auto:2-5"
-- 	   "no"	    	never
-- 	   "yes"    	always
-- 	   "yes:[1-9]"  always, with fixed space for signs up to the given
-- 	                number (maximum 9), e.g. "yes:3"
-- 	   "number"	display signs in the 'number' column. If the number
-- 			column is not present, then behaves like "auto".
-- 	Note regarding 'orphaned signs': with signcolumn numbers higher than
-- 	1, deleting lines will also remove the associated signs automatically,
-- 	in contrast to the default Vim behavior of keeping and grouping them.
-- 	This is done in order for the signcolumn appearance not appear weird
-- 	during line deletion.
vim.wo.signcolumn = "auto"
-- boolean	(default off)

-- 	When on spell checking will be done.  See |spell|.
-- 	The languages are specified with 'spelllang'.
vim.wo.spell = "false"
-- string	(default empty)
-- 			global or local to window |global-local|
-- 	When non-empty, this option determines the content of the status line.
-- 	Also see |status-line|.
-- 	The option consists of printf style '%' items interspersed with
-- 	normal text.  Each status line item is of the form:
-- 	  %-0{minwid}.{maxwid}{item}
-- 	All fields except the {item} are optional.  A single percent sign can
-- 	be given as "%%".
-- 	When the option starts with "%!" then it is used as an expression,
-- 	evaluated and the result is used as the option value.  Example: >
-- 		:set statusline=%!MyStatusLine()
-- 	window that the status line belongs to.
-- 	The result can contain %{} items that will be evaluated too.
-- 	Note that the "%!" expression is evaluated in the context of the
-- 	current window and buffer, while %{} items are evaluated in the
-- 	context of the window that the statusline belongs to.
-- 	When there is error while evaluating the option then it will be made
-- 	empty to avoid further errors.  Otherwise screen updating would loop.
-- 	Note that the only effect of 'ruler' when this option is set (and
-- 	'laststatus' is 2 or 3) is controlling the output of |CTRL-G|.

-- 	0	    Leading zeroes in numeric items.  Overridden by '-'.
-- 	minwid	    Minimum width of the item, padding as set by '-' & '0'.
-- 		    Value must be 50 or less.
-- 	maxwid	    Maximum width of the item.  Truncation occurs with a '<'
-- 		    on the left for text items.  Numeric items will be
-- 		    shifted down to maxwid-2 digits followed by '>'number
-- 		    where number is the amount of missing digits, much like

-- 	F S   Full path to the file in the buffer.
-- 	t S   File name (tail) of file in the buffer.
-- 	m F   Modified flag, text is "[+]"; "[-]" if 'modifiable' is off.
-- 	M F   Modified flag, text is ",+" or ",-".
-- 	r F   Readonly flag, text is "[RO]".
-- 	R F   Readonly flag, text is ",RO".

-- 	q S   "[Quickfix List]", "[Location List]" or empty.
-- 	k S   Value of "b:keymap_name" or 'keymap' when |:lmap| mappings are
-- 	      being used: "<keymap>"
-- 	n N   Buffer number.
-- 	b N   Value of character under cursor.
-- 	B N   As above, in hexadecimal.
-- 	o N   Byte number in file of byte under cursor, first byte is 1.
-- 	      Mnemonic: Offset from start of file (with one added)
-- 	O N   As above, in hexadecimal.
-- 	N N   Printer page number.  (Only works in the 'printheader' option.)
-- 	l N   Line number.
-- 	L N   Number of lines in buffer.
-- 	c N   Column number (byte index).
-- 	v N   Virtual column number (screen column).
-- 	V N   Virtual column number as -{num}.  Not displayed if equal to 'c'.
-- 	p N   Percentage through file in lines as in |CTRL-G|.
-- 	P S   Percentage through file of displayed window.  This is like the

-- 	a S   Argument list status as in default title.  ({current} of {max})
-- 	      Empty if the argument file count is zero or one.
-- 	{ NF  Evaluate expression between '%{' and '}' and substitute result.
-- 	      Note that there is no '%' before the closing '}'.  The
-- 	      expression cannot contain a '}' character, call a function to
-- 	      work around that.  See |stl-%{| below.
-- 	{% -  This is almost same as { except the result of the expression is

-- 	X N   For 'tabline': start of close tab N label.  Use %X or %T to end
-- 	      the label, e.g.: %3Xclose%X.  Use %999X for a "close current
-- 	      tab" label.    Clicking this label with left mouse button closes

-- 	      using left mouse button on "foo.c" "SwitchBuffer(10, 1, 'l',
-- 	      '    ')" expression will be run.  Function receives the

-- 	      1. minwid field value or zero if no N was specified
-- 	      2. number of mouse clicks to detect multiple clicks
-- 	      3. mouse button used: "l", "r" or "m" for left, right or middle
-- 	         button respectively; one should not rely on third argument
-- 	         being only "l", "r" or "m": any other non-empty string value

-- 	         contains space instead, but one should not rely on presence
-- 	         of spaces or specific order of modifiers: use |stridx()| to
-- 	         test whether some modifier is present; string is guaranteed
-- 	         to contain only ASCII letters and spaces, one letter per
-- 	         modifier; "?" modifier may also be present, but its presence
-- 	         is a bug that denotes that new mouse button recognition was
-- 	         added without modifying code that reacts on mouse clicks on

-- 	< -   Where to truncate line if too long.  Default is at the start.

-- 	# -   Set highlight group.  The name must follow and then a # again.
-- 	      Thus use %#HLname# for highlight group HLname.  The same
-- 	      highlighting is used, also for the statusline of non-current
-- 	      windows.
-- 	* -   Set highlight group to User{N}, where {N} is taken from the
-- 	      minwid field, e.g. %1*.  Restore normal highlight with %* or %0*.
-- 	      The difference between User{N} and StatusLine  will be applied
-- 	      to StatusLineNC for the statusline of non-current windows.
-- 	      The number N must be between 1 and 9.  See |hl-User1..9|
-- 	When displaying a flag, Vim removes the leading comma, if any, when
-- 	that flag comes right after plaintext.  This will make a nice display
-- 	when flags are used like in the examples below.
-- 	When all items in a group becomes an empty string (i.e. flags that are
-- 	not set) and a minwid is not set for the group, the whole group will
-- 	become empty.  This will make a group like the following disappear
-- 	completely from the statusline when none of the flags are set. >
-- 		:set statusline=...%(\ [%M%R%H]%)...
-- 	line is displayed.
-- 	While evaluating %{} the current buffer and current window will be set
-- 	temporarily to that of the window (and buffer) whose statusline is
-- 	currently being drawn.  The expression will evaluate in this context.
-- 	The variable "g:actual_curbuf" is set to the `bufnr()` number of the
-- 	real current buffer and "g:actual_curwin" to the |window-ID| of the
-- 	real current window.  These values are strings.
-- 	The 'statusline' option will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from
-- 	a modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
-- 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when 'modelineexpr' is off.
-- 	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
-- 	evaluating 'statusline' |textlock|.
-- 	If the statusline is not updated when you want it (e.g., after setting
-- 	a variable that's used in an expression), you can force an update by
-- 	using `:redrawstatus`.
-- 	A result of all digits is regarded a number for display purposes.
-- 	Otherwise the result is taken as flag text and applied to the rules
-- 	described above.
-- 	Watch out for errors in expressions.  They may render Vim unusable!
-- 	If you are stuck, hold down ':' or 'Q' to get a prompt, then quit and
-- 	edit your vimrc or whatever with "vim --clean" to get it right.
-- 	Examples:
-- 	Emulate standard status line with 'ruler' set >
-- 	  :set statusline=%<%f\ %h%m%r%=%-14.(%l,%c%V%)\ %P
-- 	  :set statusline=%<%f%h%m%r%=%b\ 0x%B\ \ %l,%c%V\ %P
-- 	  :set statusline=%<%f%=\ [%1%n%R%H]\ %-19(%3l,%02c%03V%)%O'%02b'
-- 	  :hi User1 term=inverse,bold cterm=inverse,bold ctermfg=red

-- 	  :unlet b:gzflag

-- 	    block	Allow virtual editing in Visual block mode.
-- 	    insert	Allow virtual editing in Insert mode.
-- 	    all		Allow virtual editing in all modes.
-- 	    onemore	Allow the cursor to move just past the end of the line
-- 	    none	When used as the local value, do not allow virtual
-- 			editing even when the global value is set.  When used
-- 			as the global value, "none" is the same as "".
-- 	    NONE	Alternative spelling of "none".
-- 	Virtual editing means that the cursor can be positioned where there is
-- 	no actual character.  This can be halfway into a tab or beyond the end
-- 	of the line.  Useful for selecting a rectangle in Visual mode and
-- 	editing a table.
-- 	"onemore" is not the same, it will only allow moving the cursor just
-- 	after the last character of the line.  This makes some commands more
-- 	consistent.  Previously the cursor was always past the end of the line
-- 	if the line was empty.  But it is far from Vi compatible.  It may also
-- 	break some plugins or Vim scripts.  For example because |l| can move
-- 	the cursor after the last character.  Use with care!
-- 	Using the `$` command will move to the last character in the line, not
-- 	past it.  This may actually move the cursor to the left!
-- 	The `g$` command will move to the end of the screen line.
-- 	It doesn't make sense to combine "all" with "onemore", but you will
-- 	not get a warning for it.
-- 	When combined with other words, "none" is ignored.
